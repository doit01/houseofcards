to finalize the bailout deal.敲定了救市协议
Meanwhile, Secretary Durant twiddled her thumbs, waiting与此同时杜兰特国务卿则无所事事地等候
without a seat at the bargaining table."连上谈判桌的资格都没有
Pretty wild, huh?很疯狂对吧
- When was that posted? -3:00 A.M.什么时候发的凌晨三点
You should go.你该走了
- No breakfast, even? - I have work to do.早餐都不给吗我要工作了
Welcome back. It's a dramatic day.欢迎回来这是戏剧性的一天
Let's see where things stand.我们看下现在情况
And, Wolf, you can see the big change.沃尔夫可以看到形式大变
Catherine Durant now on our presidential nominating wall.凯瑟琳杜兰特现在上了我们的总统提名墙
She has shifted from vice presidential hopeful原本有望成为副总统的她
to potential presidential candidate.转而竞争总统候选人
And a Durant candidacy might be appealing to Democrats杜兰特成为候选人或许对那些对安德伍德
who aren't enthusiastic about either Underwood or Dunbar.和邓巴都没兴趣的民主党人很有吸引力
And imagine this scenario设想一下
if we play this out through this convention.纵观整个大会的大局
Heather Dunbar came out of the primaries, of course, with 46%.希瑟邓巴退出初选时支持率是
It's not enough to win the nomination,这还不足以赢得提名
but for him to win, President Underwood,但如果安德伍德总统要取胜
he still needs these superdelegates.他还需要这些超级代表
He won the popular vote when Dunbar withdrew,邓巴退出时他赢得了选民票
but you're saying he doesn't have a technical majority.但你的意思是他还没有取得绝对多数
659 superdelegates yet to weigh in,名超级代表尚未投票
so you see Frank Underwood drops down to 48%.所以弗兰克安德伍德已经掉到了
He's still in the lead, but not enough to clinch the nomination.他依然领先但还不足以获得提名
And you want a little bit more intrigue, like we need that?想听更复杂的吗好像还不够复杂似的
Twenty-four states, Wolf, these 24 states highlighted,个州沃尔夫标亮的这个州
they do not have so-called faithless delegate laws,没有所谓的不忠代表法
meaning in these 24 states, the delegates don't have to,也就是说这个州的代表没必要
they are not legally bound to vote for the candidate法律上没有规定他们必须投票给
who won their state's primary or caucus.赢得本州岛初选或党团会议的候选人
They can vote for whoever they want.他们可以随心所欲投给任何人
They could vote for Heather Dunbar.他们可以投给希瑟邓巴
They could switch over and vote for Catherine Durant.他们可以转投给凯瑟琳杜兰特
Wolf, if they want, they could vote for you.沃尔夫如果他们想的话还可以投给你
So... They're not gonna vote for me.他们不会投给我的
But if Secretary Durant siphons off enough votes但如果杜兰特国务卿吸走了足够的选票
or Underwood doesn't get that majority in the first ballot,或是安德伍德未能在初轮投票中获得多数
what, all bets are off?那就一切皆有可能了吗
I think about the only sure bet today is我觉得今天唯一可以肯定的是
President Underwood must be wishing安德伍德总统一定恨不得
he hadn't agreed to this open convention.当初没有同意召开开放党代会
Does Durant or Dunbar really have a shot at winning this thing?杜兰特或是邓巴真的有可能取胜吗
Sure. You've got a president who wasn't elected to begin with.当然现任总统本就不是获选上台的
His health is a giant question mark right now.他的健康状况现在也是一个大问号
He's had a rocky tenure, plus you've got an open convention.他这个任期非常艰难再加上开放党代会
Anything could happen.一切皆有可能
